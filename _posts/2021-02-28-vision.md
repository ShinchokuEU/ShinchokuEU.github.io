Industry 4.0, or Smart Industry is the next wave in improving the way we engineer and manufacture things. After automation, steam and electricity, Industry 4.0 is about digitisation in manufacturing. 
At Shinchoku, we interpret this as putting computing resources to work to improve manufacturing processes. We gather data from existing production facilities and use that data to predict and define production process improvements.
What these improvements are depends completely on the needs of an individual factory, but the approach is the same for all - regardless of whether a factory requires improvements in efficiency, throughput, reliability or sustainability. 

Especially the latter is important though: the needs of the human race have led us to the Industrial world we have created in the past two centuries, at the expense of natural resources, plants and animals. In order to make this progress into real progress (Shinchoku), our aim is to make enable each of our customers to produce in a more sustainable fashion.
